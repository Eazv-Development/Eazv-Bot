In order to run the bot, you need as a dependency [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org), you need to have the intents active and know the basics of Discordjs and JavaScript.
I forgot one important thing, you need the ``Yusei`` font.

once you have downloaded the file, open cmd and go to the folder where you downloaded the file and execute the command ``npm init -y``
